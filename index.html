            Oxygen is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use 
            the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support 
            other scripts. To contribute to the project contact Vernon Adams and 
            use the KDE Project git repository.

            Source Sans Pro is a sans serif typeface created by Paul D. Hunt, 
            released by Adobe in 2012. It is the first open-source font family 
            from Adobe, distributed under the SIL Open Font License.

            Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney 
            as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and 
            Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic 
            was added in 2016. It is a display face and the download features both old style and 
            lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics,
            as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than 
            its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.

            Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, 
            Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 
            character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic 
            character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral,
             yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, 
             and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms. In March 2021, 
             the family has been updated to a variable font family and it also includes Hebrew.

            Work Sans is a typeface family based loosely on early Grotesques, 
            such as those by Stephenson Blake, Miller & Richard and Bauerschen Giesserei.
            The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for 
            on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design. 
            The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both 
            on the web and in print. Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; 
            for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print. A version optimised for
            desktop applications is available from the Work Sans github project page.
